Here’s how to create a good-looking GitHub repository for your job scraper project. I’ll guide you through structuring the repository, adding a README file with color and a banner, and ensuring it looks professional. Below are the steps you can follow.

Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

	1.	Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
	2.	Click on the New Repository button.
	3.	Name your repository (e.g., job-scraper).
	4.	Set the repository to Public.
	5.	Initialize it with a README.md file and a .gitignore for Python.
	6.	Click Create repository.

Step 2: Add a Banner Image

	•	Create a banner (1200x300 pixels or similar) using any graphic design tool (Canva, Photoshop, etc.). This banner can have a title like “AI-Powered Job Scraper” and your name as “By kdairatchi.”
	•	Save the image as banner.png.
	•	Upload the banner.png to your GitHub repository.

Step 3: Write the README.md File

Below is an example README.md file with markdown styling, a banner image, badges for dependencies and Python version, and rich formatting.
